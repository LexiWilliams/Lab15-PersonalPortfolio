        <P> Hi i'm lexi. I like cats and I have four of them. They are
            all black. I also have a dog. She is a tan and white collie mix.
            Animals are cool and I used to work in the animal care field, but it was mentally unstimulating
            and didn't pay well. I like to read and and watch crime tv in my spare time, which I currently have none of.

        <P> My hometown is White Lake, Mi. It is in the middle of nowhere, and theres nothing lakes. I's great for water
            activiites
            but not much else. It is very quiet and a great place for families. Alas, I am young with no family and it
            sucks.
